**************************Adding user to a group***************************

Following text is a decription of commands that are used to add user to a group

Information about a user's primary group can be found in /etc/passwd file.

***************************************************************************

To add user to a secondary group we use the following command: 

sudo usermod -a -G groupname/groupnames username

Note: If we omit the -a option the user will be removed from any secondary group that it is part of and added to the groupname(s) after the -G option

If successful the command does not produces any output.

Commands throws warning if username or groupname does not exists.

To add user to muiltiple groups in same command we use : 

sudo usermod -a -G group1,group2,group3 username

**To delete a user from a group, we use gpasswd command: 

sudo gpasswd -d username groupname

**To add a new group --> sudo groupadd <groupname>

**To delete an existing group --> sudo groupdel <groupname>

**How to change User's primary or login group:

sudo usermod -g <groupname> <username>

Eg. : sudo usermod -g developers swarnim

Above example will change the primary group of user swarnim to developers

**How to create user and assignn groups in a single command: 

sudo useradd -g <primary_group> -G <secondary_group1,secondary_group2> <username>

Eg. To create a user with name "swarnim" and assign primary group as "developer" and secondary groups as "lpadmin,linuxize" we execute below command 


####### sudo useradd -g developer -G lpadmin,linuxize swarnim ##########

**To display group information of user with id command-->  id <username>

**To display secondary groups of a user we use groups command:

groups <username> It will display all the secondary groups of user

If we execute groups or id command without supplying the argument then it will output group names for the currently logged in user
