********************** DELETE A GROUP*************************************

We can delete an existing group by using groupdel command.
Syntax :  groupdel <group_name>
Only the root or a user with sudo privileges can remove groups.
*** If we want to delete primary/login group of a user, then we have to delete the user associated with group first.

groupdel mygroup

** If we try to delete a group that does not exists then we will get an eror on output.
