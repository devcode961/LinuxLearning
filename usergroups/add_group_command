groups in linux are used to set priviliges like read,write and execute on resources that can be shared between users belonging to a group.

We can create a group using groupadd command.General syntax is:

GROUPADD [OPTIONS] GROUPNAME

Only root user or user with sudo privileges can create a group.
groupadd commands creates a new group with specified OPTIONS along with default values in /etc/login.defs


groupadd <group_name> will create a new group

GID or group id will be taken as the next available GID from /etc/login.defs

If we want to specify our own GID we can also do so : 

groupadd -g 1010 mytestgroup

if the GID already exist it will output error.

If we want to create group with GID that already exists, we can use:

groupadd -o -g 1010 mytestgroup

-o(--non-unique) option will allow to create group with existing group id.

****Creating a system group****
System groups are similiar to normal user groups.System groups are created for system opereation tasks such as creating a backup etc. The GID of system groups is assigned from /etc/login.defs in the range of SYS_GID_MIN and SYS_GID_MAX values

We use -r(--system) option to craete a system group: 

groupadd -r mysystemgroup

************Overriding default values in /etc/login.defs*******************
We can override the range of normal GIDs and system GIDs from /etc/login.defs when creating a group. We use -K(--key) option to override GID values.

groupadd -K GID_MIN=1200 -K GID_MAX=1500 mygroup

We can also set password while creating a group, however it is strongly discouraged practice to apply password on group.

groupadd -p mypassword mygroup
